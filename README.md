# Simple Electron

## An electron APP Framework

* The framework could be used to create a simple electron app quickly without coding much.

* The only thing you maybe need to do is to write a front_end web page. ðŸ˜ƒ

## How to use

* Make sure you have the correct nodejs, npm, yarn environment

* *side_creation* is  useless but previous code I personally dnt wanna delete.

* And the framework could also help beginners learn how to write a simple electron program (maybe)

```cmd
npm install
npm electron
```
